# sublime-scss

Sublime Text completions for SCSS. Converted from the [CSS Package at sublimehq/Packages](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages).

### Why?

This package is up-to-date with the official CSS packge for Sublime. This means there are completions for all the new CSS properties that are not in the Text Mate version of the syntax.

Here is a short list of things that the other package doesn't have:

* animations
* transforms
* transitions
* flexbox
* columns
* new `@` rules
* Improved SVG property support

### What's Missing?

Right now, the syntax highlighting is a little busted. Most nested stuff doesn't highlight properly.
